<p>math-class is a work in progress, intended to support high school courses that include math with a bit of programming related to the subject.</p>
<p>The basic idea is to give students the power to produce useful programs while focusing their attention on their subject; i.e. not transforming a math course for example, into a programming course.</p>
<p>So far, the package provides an easy way to plot graphs, including for example 2D and 3D rendering methods that require only ranges and an equation as input.</p>
<p>Examples are included. Simply edit comments in startMyJS(), file examples.js, to allow each of the examples to run. Then double-click index.htm (or reload) to run them.</p>
<p>The idea for math-class doesn't stop there. In combination with the Achieve server, file io will be supported for example. (This version of math-class runs entirely in the browser - no server required.)
<p>The math-class plotting functions rely on plotly. The software needed is included with this package.
