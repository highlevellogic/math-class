<section style="background-color:LightSkyBlue;">
<p>math-class is a work in progress, intended to provide support to high school math courses that include math related programming.</p>
<p>The basic idea is that students and teachers should have very nice features in their programming environment, while focusing their attention on math.</p>
<p>The package includes such things as file io for multi-dimensional arrays, generating data sets from equations, and is currently using plotly to plot data. Even there, interface functions are included to shield math students from the need to write plotly programs.</p>
<p>This software is also dependent on the Achieve server; which fits high school programming course environments quite well.</p>
<p>Work has started and will proceed with advice from specialized teachers.</p>
